hardrock kernel 0.4.3 change logs:
.....................................................
1) upstreamed kernel to 4.14.177
2) overclocked cpu upto 2.5 ghz big clustres and 2.1 ghz small clusters
3) small clusters have most of core values lower and one final max for better response
4) big clusters have powerful or more higer frequencies 
5) Removed unnecessary wake calls for cpu (some Unnecessary ufs wakeups)
6) Cpu goes to idle state very soon
7) THermals improvements
8) no lagging due to thermal throttle( if temp is higer or throttling, there still wont be lagging)
9) Enable high frame rates in games



** REMEMBER TO SWITCH TO SCHEDUTIL GOV AND MIN VALUE FOR BOTH CLUSTERS TO 100MHZ



Hardrock Kernel Change logs v0.4.2
--------------------------------------------------
reverted overclock(Shdn't be doing it)
Kept underclock to 100mhz
added improved interactive governor



Hardrock Kernel Change logs v0.4.1
---------------------------------------------------
First kernel to support UC and OC for snapdragon 730G
UNDERCLOCK TO 100MHZ (set min freq to 100mhz from FK)
OVERCLOCK Little core to 2 ghz and big cores to 2.4 GHZ ( please set it from FKM)
Upstreamed kernel 4.14.176
Dynamic fsync
Singlequeue io-scheduler: bfq-sq
ZRAM improvements and used LZ4 as default compression algorithm to improve Memory Managment.
Gpu performance improvements

**Note PLease let kernel settle for 5 mins due to improvements in schedutil ..


Hardrock Kernel Change logs v0.3
---------------------------------------------------
exfat support
kcal
klapse
gpu optimizations and performance improvements( no gpu wakeup on unneeded touches)
wireguard: update to version 1.0.20200401
low latency
disabled gentle fair sleepers and cpu
improved bbr tcp congestion algorithm (by default selected)
ufs optimizations
improved power saving
thermal power effiecient workqueue
removed unnecesary logging and traces to reduce unnecessary overhead
fixed youtube playback issues maybe occuring on custom roms
added steam valve controller support
improved schedutil governor

** GUys its recommended to hold kernel for few cycles and let it settle..have patience lol



Hardrock Kernel Change logs v0.2
----------------------------------------------------
Applied Sultan simple LMK
Memory optimizations
Sched optimizations
memory utilities optimizations(memcpy and memmove)
Sound Enhancements
